1. Introduction to Node.js

What is Node.js?

Definition: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Purpose: It allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling server-side and backend development.

Why Use Node.js?

Non-blocking I/O: Handles multiple tasks simultaneously using an event loop.

Single Programming Language: Use JavaScript for both frontend and backend.

Rich Ecosystem: NPM (Node Package Manager) offers thousands of reusable packages.

High Performance: Built on V8 engine, optimized for speed.

Key Features of Node.js

Event-Driven Architecture: Handles asynchronous operations efficiently.

Scalability: Suitable for building scalable network applications.

Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
